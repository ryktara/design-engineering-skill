## Guidance per slot
- **navigation** — Fixed-width rail (collapsible to icons with labels on hover/focus) holding grouped sections; secondary navigation lives in the content header, not as a second rail. Don't add a rail because 'apps have sidebars': justify it with section count and switching frequency. Mark active section with a visible indicator that survives collapse. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **layout** — Keep the current layout; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **density** — Keep the current density; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **surface** — One neutral canvas, borders with ≥3:1 contrast where they define panes, headers as slightly darker/lighter strips, no rounded card containers inside panes. Focus rings and selection highlights carry the colour. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **cards** — Keep the current cards; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **typography** — Keep the current typography; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **color** — Neutral scale with a slight brand tint (not pure grey), one accent used for ≤10% of the screen, feedback colours distinct from the accent by hue family (error must not be the accent's hue). Charts get their own categorical palette. Validate every pair with tokens.py. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **motion** — Keep the current motion; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **focus** — Keep the current focus; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **cta** — Keep the current cta; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **imagery** — Keep the current imagery; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **icon** — Keep the current icon; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **metadata** — Keep the current metadata; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)

## Core guidance (components / layouts to build)
- **Settings screen** — Grouped rows with clear labels and current values visible, toggles for booleans with immediate effect, pickers for enums, destructive actions at the end with confirmation, search for long settings, platform idiom (grouped lists on mobile, sections/panes on desktop, TV: vertical list with DPAD and a right-side value column). Save behaviour explicit (auto vs Save button).
- **Plan comparison and billing management** — Plans are a radio group of equal-width cards with the current plan marked in text (not colour only), prices with tabular figures and the billing period stated, a feature list with real text (no bare check marks without labels), and one primary action per state (Upgrade / Downgrade / Current); every card is one Tab stop with a visible focus ring, arrow keys move between plans; seat management is a data table (name, role, status, last active) with row actions reachable from the keyboard and a bulk selection state; invoice history is a table with date, amount (tabular), status text + icon and a real download link (not a hover-only icon); plan changes and seat removals confirm in a dialog that states the billing consequence and returns focus; billing settings sub-navigation is a vertical list with aria-current.

## Guardrails (required concerns: accessibility, interaction, component, data-display; uncovered: accessibility, interaction)
**accessibility**
- One type scale with named roles: Roles display/heading/title/body/label/caption/numeric with size, line height, weight, and letter spacing per role; body ≥16 px web/mobile, 14 desktop, 24 TV; numeric role uses tabular lining figures; headings use tighter line height (1.1–1.25) and body 1.4–1.6. Generate with tokens.py scale and map the roles to the framework's text styles. _(covers: tabular figures and numeric alignment, type roles and scale)_
**states**
- Design empty, loading, error, and partial states: Empty: what this is, why it is empty, one action. Loading: skeleton with final dimensions, then content; announce completion. Error: what failed, what to do, retry that works; keep entered data. Partial: show what loaded, mark what didn't. On TV, focus must land somewhere valid in each state. _(covers: loading, empty and error states)_

## Fingerprint
```json
{
  "navigation_model": "left-rail",
  "surface_strategy": "bordered",
  "card_geometry": "none",
  "corner_language": "sharp",
  "color_strategy": "neutral-plus-accent"
}
```

## Validation: OK

Reconcile every slot with the existing codebase before implementing; preserved slots are the existing system and win unless the task is to change them. Guardrails are not optional.
