## Guidance per slot
- **navigation** — Put primary destinations in a single horizontal bar; collapse to a menu button below the container width rather than hiding destinations one by one. The active item must be marked by more than colour (underline, weight, or aria-current). On narrow widths, the bar keeps the brand mark and one primary action visible. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **layout** — Table fills the viewport height with internal scrolling and sticky header, row density selectable, column widths persisted, filters as a row of chips/fields above the table (not a hidden drawer), bulk actions appear in the toolbar on selection. Numeric columns right-aligned with tabular figures. Virtualise beyond a few hundred rows.
- **density** — Keep the current density; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **surface** — One neutral canvas, borders with ≥3:1 contrast where they define panes, headers as slightly darker/lighter strips, no rounded card containers inside panes. Focus rings and selection highlights carry the colour. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **cards** — Keep the current cards; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **typography** — Keep the current typography; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **color** — Neutral scale with a slight brand tint (not pure grey), one accent used for ≤10% of the screen, feedback colours distinct from the accent by hue family (error must not be the accent's hue). Charts get their own categorical palette. Validate every pair with tokens.py. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **motion** — Keep the current motion; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **focus** — Keep the current focus; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **cta** — Keep the current cta; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **imagery** — Keep the current imagery; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **icon** — Keep the current icon; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)
- **metadata** — Keep the current metadata; inspect and reuse it. (Existing system: do not replace it for this task.)

## Core guidance (components / layouts to build)
- **Toast / snackbar / banner** — Toast: bottom (mobile) or bottom-left/top-right (desktop) consistent position, ≥5 s or until dismissed, undo where applicable, live region polite. Banner: inline at the top of the region it concerns, dismissible if non-critical. TV: brief overlay in the safe area that never steals focus.

## Guardrails (required concerns: accessibility, interaction, component; uncovered: none)
**interaction**
- Drag and drop: affordance, feedback, keyboard alternative, no layout thrash: Show a grip or lift affordance; on lift raise the item (shadow/scale) and move it with a transform only; show a snapped drop target with the value it will take (time slot, column); write state once on drop; provide a keyboard/button alternative (arrow keys or a 'Move to…' menu) with focus kept on the moved item; announce the result in a live region; Escape cancels; respect reduced motion. _(covers: discoverable gestures, keyboard navigation and focus order, live region status announcements, no layout shift)_
- Bypass blocks: skip links and landmark shortcuts: Provide a 'Skip to <region>' link as the first focusable element (visible on focus), targets with tabindex=-1 and a heading; expose landmarks (main, nav, region with aria-label) so screen-reader users can jump; keep the number of tab stops before the first control small (≤ 5) and give composite widgets a single tab stop. _(covers: semantic structure and roles, keyboard navigation and focus order)_
- Never colour alone: Pair colour with text, icon, pattern, weight, or underline. Error fields get an icon and message; chart series get labels or line styles; links in prose get underlines; selected rows get a check or a border, not only a tint. _(covers: no colour alone for status, selected state visible and distinct from focus and hover)_
**accessibility**
- One clear focal point per screen: Decide the screen's job and the one element that serves it; give that element the strongest size/contrast/position; demote everything else by one or two steps; navigation and chrome are quieter than content. On dashboards the focal point is the most important metric or the anomaly, not the page title. _(covers: visual hierarchy with one focal point, one primary action per view, exceptions and anomalies first)_
- Text contrast 4.5:1 (3:1 large): Body and label text ≥4.5:1, large text (≥24 px or ≥19 px bold) ≥3:1, AAA target 7:1 for long reading and for TV. Measure with tokens.py contrast, never estimate. Placeholder text is text and must pass. _(covers: high contrast)_
- Accessible names for every control and image: Visible label for inputs (not placeholder-only), aria-label/accessibilityLabel/contentDescription/AutomationProperties.Name for icon-only controls, alt text for meaningful images and alt="" for decorative ones, link text that makes sense out of context. The accessible name must contain the visible label text (label in name). _(covers: accessible names and labels)_

## Validation: OK

## Alternatives considered
- layout: Catalog grid (0.222), Master–detail (list + detail pane) (0.222), Single column, one task (0.222)

Reconcile every slot with the existing codebase before implementing; preserved slots are the existing system and win unless the task is to change them. Guardrails are not optional.
